# Keeping Your BLCP Account Secure

At BLCP, we take your security seriously. This guide will help you understand the security measures we've implemented and what you can do to keep your account safe.

## Account Security Basics

### Creating a Strong Password

Your first line of defense is a strong password:

✅ **DO**:
- Use at least 8 characters
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Add numbers and special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- Create a unique password just for BLCP

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use personal information (name, birthday)
- Reuse passwords from other websites
- Use sequential characters (123456, abcdef)
- Share your password with others

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

For maximum security, enable two-factor authentication:

1. Go to "Account Settings" > "Security"
2. Click "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
3. Choose your preferred verification method (SMS or Authentication App)
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup

With 2FA enabled, you'll need both your password and a temporary code to access your account.

## Safe Shopping Practices

### Protect Your Account Information

- Log out when using shared or public computers
- Never share your account password, even with customer service
- Update your password regularly (every 3-6 months)
