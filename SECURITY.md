# Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the BLCP application and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure system.

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Dual authentication system (Firebase Auth + JWT)
- **Secure Token Handling**: 
  - Algorithm enforcement (HS256)
  - Token expiration
  - Secure validation
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Admin-only routes and functionality
  - User-specific data access restrictions
  - Firebase custom claims for role management

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: 
  - Implemented on sensitive endpoints (authentication, webhooks)
  - Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**:
  - Express-validator for request validation
  - Data sanitization for all user inputs
- **CORS Protection**:
  - Environment-specific CORS configuration
  - Origin validation for cross-origin requests
  - Limited allowed methods and headers

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Secrets stored in environment variables
  - Example env file with placeholders
  - Different configuration for development/production
- **Secure Data Handling**:
  - User data access restrictions
  - Parameterized queries for database operations
  - Data validation before processing

### Payment Security
- **Webhook Signature Verification**:
  - HMAC-based signature validation
  - Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- **Secure Payment Processing**:
  - Payment gateway integration with redirection
  - No storage of sensitive payment data
  - Transaction logging for audit trails

### Web Security
- **Security Headers**:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
- **Request Size Limiting**:
  - JSON body size limits to prevent DoS attacks

## Vulnerability Mitigation

The following vulnerabilities were identified and mitigated:

### Credential Exposure
- **Issue**: API keys and secrets exposed in code
- **Mitigation**: Moved all secrets to environment variables, created template with placeholders

### JWT Implementation Issues
- **Issue**: Missing algorithm enforcement in JWT validation
- **Mitigation**: Added explicit algorithm specification and proper error handling

### Webhook Security
- **Issue**: Insufficient webhook validation and exposed webhook secret
- **Mitigation**: Implemented proper signature verification and environment variable usage

### CORS Vulnerabilities
- **Issue**: Overly permissive CORS settings
- **Mitigation**: Implemented strict origin validation and environment-specific configurations

### Admin Access Control
- **Issue**: Inconsistent admin verification
- **Mitigation**: Created consistent, robust admin validation with proper error handling

## Security Guidelines

### Authentication Best Practices
1. **Use strong passwords**: Enforce password complexity requirements
2. **Implement MFA**: Consider adding additional factors for sensitive operations
3. **Token hygiene**: Store tokens securely, never in localStorage
4. **Session management**: Implement proper logout and token invalidation

### API Security Guidelines
1. **Always validate input**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
2. **Rate limit sensitive endpoints**: Prevent abuse and brute force attacks
3. **Implement proper error handling**: Never expose sensitive details in errors
4. **Log security events**: Maintain audit trails for security-related operations

### Payment Processing Guidelines
1. **Always verify webhook signatures**: Never process unverified payment notifications
2. **Implement idempotency**: Prevent duplicate payment processing
3. **Secure redirects**: Validate all return URLs for payment flows
4. **PCI compliance**: Follow PCI DSS guidelines for handling payment data

### Environment Security
1. **Secret rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
2. **Environment separation**: Use different keys for development and production
3. **Access control**: Limit access to production environment variables
4. **Audit logging**: Log access to sensitive operations

## Security Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring Practices
1. **Implement centralized logging**: Aggregate logs for security analysis
2. **Set up alerts**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities
3. **Regular audits**: Conduct periodic security audits
4. **Dependency scanning**: Monitor for vulnerable dependencies

### Incident Response
1. **Create an incident response plan**: Document steps for security incidents
2. **Define security contacts**: Establish clear points of contact
3. **Practice recovery**: Test backup and recovery procedures
4. **Document lessons learned**: Update security measures based on incidents

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Security
1. **Use secure coding practices**:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Escape outputs
   - Use parameterized queries
2. **Conduct code reviews**: Include security in review process
3. **Automated testing**: Implement security-focused automated tests
4. **Dependency management**: Regularly update dependencies

### Deployment Security
1. **Secure CI/CD pipeline**: Protect build and deployment processes
2. **Infrastructure as code**: Use version-controlled infrastructure definitions
3. **Immutable deployments**: Prefer immutable infrastructure patterns
4. **Secrets management**: Use a secure secrets management solution

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose publicly**: Avoid posting about the vulnerability in public forums
2. **Contact the security team**: Report the issue directly to security@example.com
3. **Provide details**: Include steps to reproduce and potential impact
4. **Allow time for response**: Give reasonable time for assessment and mitigation
